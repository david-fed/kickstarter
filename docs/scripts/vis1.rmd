### Amount of Kickstarter projects by category

Projects on Kickstarter are split up in categories and subcategories. To see for what Kickstarter is mainly used for, let's look at the relative amount of projects by category:

```{r, tidy = 'styler'}
category.relative.frequency <- table(kickstarter$Category) / length(kickstarter$Category) * 100

par(mar=c(8, 6, 4, 2))
category.barplot <- barplot(
  sort(category.relative.frequency, decreasing = TRUE),
  las = 2,
  main = "Amount of Kickstarter projects by category",
  col = "#05ce78",
  ylim = c(0, 20),
  border = "white"
)
title(xlab="Category", line=6)
title(ylab="Relative frequency (%)", line=3)
text(
  x = category.barplot,
  y = sort(category.relative.frequency, decreasing = TRUE) + 0.5,
  labels = round(
    sort(category.relative.frequency,
         decreasing = TRUE
    ),
    1)
)

# Mean relative frequency abline
abline(h = mean(category.relative.frequency), col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
text(x = max(category.barplot)-1, y = mean(category.relative.frequency), labels = paste("Mean:", round(mean(category.relative.frequency), 2)), pos = 3, col = "red")

```

This isn't astounding. Categories like Film & Video, Music, Games, and Technology are among the most represented in the dataset, as these are things everybody uses and likes. After Fashion, we see a sharp drop in the number of projects, which makes sense, as Theater, Crafts, and Dance are relatively niche categories.
