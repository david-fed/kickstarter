# Visualization 1

To get a feel of the dataset we'll make a simple visualization. Projects on Kickstarter are split up in categories and subcategories. So to see for what Kickstarter is used let's look at the relative amount of projects by category:
```{r}
category.relative.frequency <- table(kickstarter$Category) / length(kickstarter$Category) * 100

par(mar=c(8, 6, 4, 2))
category.barplot <- barplot(
  sort(category.relative.frequency, decreasing = TRUE),
  las = 2,
  main = "Amount of Kickstarter projects by category",
  col = "#05ce78",
  ylim = c(0, 20),
  border = "white"
)
title(xlab="Category", line=6)
title(ylab="Relative frequency (%)", line=3)
text(
  x = category.barplot,
  y = sort(category.relative.frequency, decreasing = TRUE) + 0.5,
  labels = round(
    sort(category.relative.frequency,
         decreasing = TRUE
    ),
    1)
)

# Mean relative frequency abline
abline(h = mean(category.relative.frequency), col = "red", lty = 2, lwd = 2)
text(x = max(category.barplot)-1, y = mean(category.relative.frequency), labels = paste("Mean:", round(mean(category.relative.frequency), 2)), pos = 3, col = "red")

```

This isn't that surprising. Categories like "Film & Video", Music, Games & Technology are amongst the most represented in the dataset, as these are things everybody uses and likes. After Fashion we see a sharp drop in amount of projects, which make sense, as Theater, Crafts and Dance are relatively niche things.
